# ChatSHODAN
My first attempt at exploring meta-prompting using OpenAI API to create specific personalities for a chat bot.

You can define the role/persona/skills and speaking style of your bot, and assuming GPT has the capability to model it, it will attempt to answer according to your set parameters.

ChatSHODAN uses the GPT-3.5 API. There is no fine-tuning, it is relying on its own pre-trained training data. [SHODAN](https://youtu.be/5iZMD_eCpEo) is a fictional AGI antagonist from a 25-year-old video game set on a space station. She will chat with the user according to the voice and facts defined in my meta-prompt.
